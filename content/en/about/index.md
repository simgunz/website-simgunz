My name is Simone Gaiarin and I am telecommunications engineer, software developer, and an open-source enthusiast. I started using GNU/Linux in 2006 and quickly began to enjoy it. In time, I began to hack around with the system, writing scripts and finally I begin to program non-hello-world software. Now I contribute to the KDE project. I also have many computer unrelated interests, such as reading, hiking, traveling, experimenting, and in general I am always looking to learn new things and try new experiences.

## The site

I have created this site mainly to provide a showcase of my projects, and receive feedback and new ideas about them in the hope to improve them.

Moreover, this site is a space where I can pour all my thoughts about Linux and related things. In particular, I would like to share the solutions to the problems I face when I program. Sometimes I have spent days to solve really weird problems or to understand tricky internal mechanisms of KDE. Writing about them would be a good opportunity to help other newbie programmers like me to save time and to not get too frustrated while programming.

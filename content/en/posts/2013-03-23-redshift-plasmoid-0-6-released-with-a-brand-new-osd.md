In this new version of redshift plasmoid I've added a simple OSD that displays the current color temperature when in manual mode. The displayed information can be used to set a correct day and night color temperature in the settings page. Moreover, thanks to the contribution of some users, redshift plasmoid is being translated in different languages.

<!--more-->If you have any advice or comment on redshift, please post it, so I can understand how you like it and how I can improve it.

Changelog:

  * Add osd for manual mode
  * Add German translation (thanks to Matthias Mail√§nder)
  * Add French translation (thanks to Pierre Buard)
  * Fix cmake dependecies
  * Fix KCFG translation context
  * Add missing icons

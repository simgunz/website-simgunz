I've recently moved from Chakra Linux to Manjaro Linux. Here I'm not going to explain why Manjaro and all the Arch-based distro are so fantastic, but I only want to point out why for me Manjaro it's a better choice than Chakra.<!--more-->

My basic motivation is that I do not have (anymore) the time to tinker to install the software.

Compared to Chakra, Manjaro offers a wider choice of software (even the less common one) most of which is directly available in the official repositories (that are clones of the Arch ones, but the software is double-checked before being released). Having more software in the repositories means it's less likely to have to compile it from source, which lead in a waste of time. Moreover Manjaro uses AUR, the biggest collection of software ever existed. On the other hand Chakra uses CCR, i.e., the Chakra Community Repository. The problem with CCR is that it's not as furbished and up-to-date as AUR is. for this reason, when I was using Chakra, it happened many time that I couldn't find the software I needed and so I began building a PKGBUILD to get the software. The problem is that this operation can be quite time consuming. The community of Chakra is not as big as the one of Arch, and because of this it will be practically impossible to make CCR as good as AUR. Furthermore, I think that creating a clone of AUR is a waste of effort. I think that the Manjaro-way is the best: it reduces the risk of breaking the system due to bleeding edge updates (as Chakra does) but reuse what is already available instead of recreating it from scratch.

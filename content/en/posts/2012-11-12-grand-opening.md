Finally, after a lot of hard work simgunz's Blog is up and running.

I've made this blog mainly to provide a homepage for my projects, so that I can share news about them and receive feedback and ideas from the users (I hope).<!--more-->

Furthermore, it will be a place to share thoughts about free software related stuff and to share solutions to the problems I face when I program.

This blog will be also a web developing experiment. The last site I developed was when I was 14 years old (it was written in Comics Sans and it was full of animated gif, very 90′s), so it's time to upgrade my web developing skills.

I hope you enjoy it.

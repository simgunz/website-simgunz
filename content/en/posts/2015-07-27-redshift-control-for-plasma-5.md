Just a quick update to inform you that today a user called clearmartin released a plasmoid called Redshift Control for Plasma 5. <!--more-->I know that many of you were waiting for the Plasma 5 porting since long time, but unfortunately the porting of Redshift plasmoid is still not complete. I&#8217;ve begun the porting of the backend and the github user ochurlaud wrote the QML interface, but also due to the lack of documentation,  we still haven&#8217;t finished. In any case the new plasmoid seems very nice even tough it lacks some feature as activity support and OSD which may be added in the future. Moreover it&#8217;s written in full QML so it doesn&#8217;t need to be compiled and can be readily installed by anyone. You can get it directly via Plasma, by using the &#8220;Get new widget&#8221; functionality. 

[Here][1] the Kde-apps page. Congratulation to clearmartin who did a neat work.
